\textbf{Cracked application} Premium applications need a license key/passcode to work. A cracked application is illegally modified version of that premium app in order to bypass that verification.\\

\textbf{System call} A function/procedure call made by a process to system/kernel.\\

\textbf{Trojan-SMS malware} A Trojan is hidden code segments inside a ``normal-looking'' app, A Trojan-SMS malware targets exploiting cellular sms service in user's mobile device.\\

\textbf{Greyware} A benign application that is vague about what it does.\\

\textbf{Mal-advertising} Malware attacks through In-app-advertisement.\\

\textbf{Virtual machine (VM)} A virtual environment simulating an original device.\\

\textbf{DNS} Domain Name Server.\\

\textbf{Malicious Repackaged Applications (MRA)}  Malicious codes piggy-backed into a benign Android application.\\

\textbf{APK} Android application package (APK) is the package file format used to distribute and install application software and middleware onto Google's Android operating system and sometimes on the BlackBerry OS 10.\\

\textbf{Port number} A port is a logical construct that identifies a service or process. A port number is an identifier of a specific port.\\

\textbf{ADB} Android Debug Bridge is a versatile command line tool that facilitates communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android-powered device.\\

\textbf{Classifier} In AI, a classifier is a function that use pattern matching to determine a closest match.\\

\textbf{Rooted device} To \"root\" an android device means to gain administrative rights on the filesystem of the device (in linux, root is the username of the superuser). With root access, anything can be installed in or uninstalled from the device.\\

\textbf{strace} strace is a diagnostic/debugging utility for linux used to monitor interactions between processes and the linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries etc..\\

\textbf{timeout} enables a linux command to run with a specified time limit.\\

\textbf{Android NDK} The NDK is a toolset developed by Google that allows implementation of parts of an android app using native-code languages such as C and C++. Typically, good use cases for the NDK are CPU-intensive applications such as game engines, signal processing, and physics simulation.\\

\textbf{AAPT} Android Asset Packaging Tool, a part of the SDK (and build system) and allows to view, create, and update Zip-compatible archives (zip, jar, apk).\\

\textbf{Confusion Matrix} In the field of machine learning, a confusion matrix, also known as a contingency table or an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one.\\
